# FODMAP Pantry

## Background
For this Unit 2 project I was required to build a complete CRUD app and use all 7 RESTful Routes, connected to a Mongo Database via Mongoose as we had been learning through weeks 5 and 6. I also had to set up a Heroku account to host the project so that it could be accessed publicly and remain connected to the database. I chose to use this opportunity to develop the back end requirements for the Nutrition App I did for our Unit 1 project. I started a clean project separate from the Unit 1 project to ensure the integrity of that projects code and reduce troubleshooting issues.

##Struggles

## Resources:
- save session user as variable to send to all templates: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37183766/how-to-get-the-session-value-in-ejs
- I relied heavily on the markdowns from w06d04, w06d05, w07d01 instructor notes to get login, routes and heroku connection setup.
